** This is a transcript (uncensored) from the video call**

----------------------------------------

**Q**: First of all I like to thank you for this short interview but let's get right to it. Is Firefox privacy friendly?! 

**A**: Firefox is privacy-respecting. There is a difference between data collection and privacy.


**Q**: What about the studies? 

**A**: System addons/studies data are protected.


**Q**: Can you explain us hw they are protected and how Mozilla is different from Google in this case?

**A**: We encrypt all findings (same like Google) + the data getting deleted after a short amount of time, no private information are collect which can expose you. 


**Q**: What about [GetPocket](https://getpocket.com/privacy)?

**A**: In addition to the information that you provide to us when you register for a user account, we collect information about the URLs, titles and content of the web pages and other information you save to Pocket. The types of information we collect includes your browser type, device type, time zone, language, and other information related to the manner in which you access the Pocket Technologies. If you are on a mobile device, we collect the advertising identifiers provided by Apple on iOS and by Google on Android. You can change this identifier in your device settings. We also collect information about your use of the Pocket Technologies so that we can provide our services. For example, as a part of providing Pocket’s syncing features, we sync information about the items that you save and view within Pocket so that your list, tags, scroll position, and other account and usage information may be synced across all of your devices. I hope this explains it all. 

**Q**: But server-side nothing was open-sourced, why not?!


**A**: All ads are served locally which means no data moves between the local FF installation and third parties, we don#t see any reason to open the server (which then might opens a hole for attacker).


**Q**: Interesting how are the ads pushed back to Mozilla if everything is locally?


**A**: Some recommendations aka ads are first served locally but after the process is done, the tracking code connects to Mozilla server with the results. Also then the rest of the advertisements don't need to do this because they were in the first place processed on the servers. Mozilla has an agreement with Google to not send anything more than the bare minimum for GA and Safebrowsing.


**Q**: Back to Pocket recommendations, does it collect my ID?

**A**: The ID is just for Mozilla to track installations for analytic and troubleshooting purposes. 


**Q**: Do you seriously believe Google is a better choice? That a monopoly whose business model is almost entirely based on targeting and selling ads is okay?

**A**: It's unfortunately that we only have two choices available. Chromium and Firefox or their forks now after Edge moves to Chromium. We can already now see how websites favours Chromium and that certainly is a bad move. But we don't have anymore proper private choices over browsers. Firefox & Mozilla is silently changing and Chrome will be the same that it has always been. That's never a good thing when the 'web' will be controlled by one big monopoly and shall not be controlled by Mozilla's projects too.


**Q**: Google is the biggest contributor and maintainer of Chromium. They do not care about privacy, whereas that is one of Mozilla's core principles, is this correct?!

**A**: Chromium _overall_ collects less data than Firefox. There's zero (!) no additional studies. The dangerous thing is that most people don't know about Firefox's data collection and therefore always "blames" Chromium's data collection. And on Firefox I have heard nothing exciting on the privacy and security aside from the Quantum dump. Instead I just see privacy violations. It's good time now for the Mozilla to start the data collection after the trust from Quantum. And back in the day things were done in software, and the actual released software spoke more about freedom than any marketing words. Also why Mozilla almost constantly makes actions which are against their "core principles"? Is this the open web what we want?:

We’re investing in people, programs, and projects that disrupt "misinformation" online.

Specifically, we’re seeking projects that explore artificial intelligence and machine learning. In a world where biased algorithms, skewed data sets, and broken recommendation engines can radicalize YouTube users, promote racism, and spread fake news,it’s more important than ever to support artwork and advocacy work that educates and engages internet users.

“Talk rethinks how moderation, comment display and conversation can function on news websites. It encourages more meaningful interactions between journalists and the people they serve.”

Mozilla’s already working on a few ideas, like Coral Project’s Talk Tool, which aims to reinvent the comments section for safer, smarter conversation. Political ad-transparency is just one of the many areas we need to improve to strengthen our electoral processes for the digital age. Transparency alone won’t solve misinformation problems or election hacking. "But at Mozilla, we believe transparency is the most critical piece".

The ProPublica tool collects the ads you’re seeing on Facebook and sends them to ProPublica’s public database for researchers, journalists, and digital citizens to help increase transparency and accountability around political advertising.

This initiative complements the work we’ve been doing at Mozilla to invest in technologies and tools, research and communities, to fight against information pollution and honour our commitment to an internet that elevates "critical thinking, reasoned argument, shared knowledge, and verifiable facts".


**Q**: This Mozilla's 'we save the web' campaign is ridiculous and filled with shady marketing. Mozilla's open web = Internet censorship based on how Mozilla and associated projects thinks! And our donations are going to this bullshit. Here's the Google is the "bad guy" - anti-privacy, anti-freedom, caring about profit and ignoring the user; while Mozilla is the "good guy", pretending to be the opposite but is actually following the same principles.

**A**: I see this different. 


**Q**: I assume your browser of choice is Chromium?

**A**: Currently I'm using a chromium based browser, this is correct.




* Interview between CHEF-KOCH + M. Shawn (Mozilla Developer) which answered my questions. 
* _07.01.2019_ 
* At this point I like to say thank you for the interesting discussion and you points of view as a Mozilla developer there was sadly not enough time to get an answer to all of my questions.
